Georgia Tech's Alpha Tau chapter of Kappa Sigma was founded in 1895 and remains one of the strongest chapters throughout the nation. The chapter's allegiance to its four principles: Fellowship, Leadership, Scholarship, and Service has yielded a 115-year history on campus full of tradition as well as a legacy of excellence.Currently, our chapter consists of more than 75 Brothers and spans across numerous involvements on campus. We have a strong alumni base in the greater Atlanta area that constantly supports our undergraduate brothers. With members in over 20 student organizations including the GT Rugby team, the Ramblin' Reck Club, Connect with Tech, the GT Soccer team, Freshman Activities Board and the Water Ski Club, the brothers make an unrivaled impact at Tech. One of our members currently serves on the Executive Board of the Interfraternity Council. The chapter celebrates the Tech Homecoming and Greek Weeks by competing in their traditional events. Kappa Sigma received First Place in Homecoming display in Fall 2010.Also, Kappa Sigma is very active in fraternal and independent intramural sports, and won the 2010 Softball Championship.The Kappa Sigma fraternity at Georgia Tech is a determined group of young men who hope to continue in tradition and achievement on and off campus.",
